- Not going to deal with HTTPs for my service because of time and convenience
- I don't deal with logging
- I don't deal with service and health metrics
- I assume we're ok with rounding errors
- this is by far not production ready
- I am not dealing with locale details, like decimal points (e.g. is it "," or ".")
- not providing configuration on how to round numbers, including precision
- I didn't bother setting up codestyle
- I didn't test if I need to manage my filedb (there are options to rebuild it -- to reclaim space).
- I assume enough disk space and enough heap memory to store my stats
- I didn't bother setting up different test groups
- didn't set up code coverage, which we should get to as close as 100%
- no integration tests
- I am not closing the file db properly
